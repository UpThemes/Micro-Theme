Changelog:

v1.6 (2011-08-30)
  - Vast improvements to the plugin architecture
  - Multiple instances of FlexSlider are now possible. (Please, consider your audience before going crazy with this)
  - Removed the "show" animation option in interest of other things. Use animationDuration: 0, if needed.
  - FlexSlider CSS has been updated. Use the v1.6 stylesheet!

v1.5 (2011-08-27)
	- Improved mobile support by adding "touchstart" to bound events
	- Implemented solution for no javascript fallback (relies on user, and prepares for html5 boilerplate/modernizr classes)
--

v1.4 (2011-08-23)
  - Added "manualControls" property to allow for custom, non-dynamic control navigation
  - Added "show" animation to allow for instant transitions between slides
--

v1.3 (2011-08-18)
  - Made slide animation a continuous scroll effect, rather than jumping back to start/end
  - Cleaned up code and created better test cases for different slider scenarios. The slider is a lot more bulletproof as of this update.

v1.2 (2011-08-16)
  - Fixed some code redundancies
  - Added "randomize" property to randomize slide oder on pageLoad
  - Added "touchSwipe" property for swipe gestures on iOS and Android devices (no Android device to test this, but it should work)
  - Fixed minor bugs in jQuery 1.3.2 where navigation was not appending correctly
